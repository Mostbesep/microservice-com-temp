# Microservice Commercial Template (microservice-com-temp)
### A commercial-grade template for building a scalable and maintainable microservices architecture, using Golang, GraphQL, gRPC, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL.
## Overview
The microservice-com-temp template provides a foundation for building a robust and efficient microservices-based system. This project includes:
A set of Go (Golang) services that communicate with each other using gRPC
A GraphQL API layer for exposing the service functionality to clients
Elasticsearch integration for storing and querying data
PostgreSQL database for persisting business logic
### Features
### Service Architecture
The template consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or capability. These services are designed to be loosely coupled, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
### GraphQL API
A GraphQL API layer is provided on top of the service architecture, enabling clients to query and mutate data using a simple, intuitive interface.
### gRPC Communication
Services communicate with each other using gRPC, which provides efficient, high-performance communication over HTTP/2 or TCP.
### Elasticsearch Integration
Elasticsearch is used for storing and querying large amounts of data. This allows for fast search capabilities and scalable indexing.
### PostgreSQL Database
A PostgreSQL database is provided to store business logic and persist service state.
